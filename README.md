**step-by-step guide** to **run the code** in a **production environment** after the React app is built. Here's the process:

---

### Step 1: Build the React App

1. **Ensure the App is Ready for Production**

   Before building the app, make sure your environment variables (like the Google Maps API key) are properly set in your `.env` file.

   ```bash
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Run the Build Command**

   Build the app for production using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create a `build/` directory in your project folder containing the production-ready files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).

---

### Step 2: Serve the Build Locally (Optional)
1. **Clone git repo**

```
   git clone git@github.com:adeojoemmanuel/dev-post-map-hackerton.git
```

2. **Install a Static Server**

   To preview the production build locally, you can use a simple static server like `serve`:

   Install the `serve` package globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   ```

3. **Serve the Build Directory**

   After installation, run the following command to serve the `build/` directory:

   ```bash
   serve -s build
   ```

4. **View the App**

   Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to see the production version of your React app.

---

### Step 3: Deploy the App to a Web Server

After building the app, you'll want to deploy it to a server for public access. Here are common deployment methods:

#### Option 1: Deploy to **Netlify**

1. **Install the Netlify CLI (Optional)**

   If you want to use Netlify’s command-line interface, install it:

   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Deploy via the CLI**

   Deploy your app by running:

   ```bash
   netlify deploy --dir=build
   ```

   Follow the CLI instructions to configure the deployment.

#### Option 2: Deploy to **Vercel**

1. **Install the Vercel CLI (Optional)**

   If you prefer using the Vercel CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy via the CLI**

   Deploy your app using:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

   Vercel will prompt you through the deployment process, including project setup and linking.

#### Option 3: Deploy to **Firebase Hosting**

1. **Install the Firebase CLI**

   Install the Firebase CLI globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**

   Log in using your Google account:

   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Initialize Firebase Hosting**

   Inside your project folder, initialize Firebase:

   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```

   During the initialization, select **Hosting**, and when asked for the public directory, type `build`.

4. **Deploy**

   Deploy the app using:

   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

#### Option 4: Deploy to an **Apache or Nginx Server**

1. **Copy the Build Files**

   After the build is done, copy the contents of the `build/` folder to the web root folder of your server, such as `/var/www/html/` for Apache or Nginx.

2. **Configure Apache or Nginx**

   If needed, configure your server to serve the React app properly (you may need to configure rewrite rules for single-page apps).

---

### Step 4: Test the Live App

Once deployed, you can access the app from the live URL provided by the hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, etc.), or directly from the server’s IP/domain if self-hosted.

---

### Summary

To run your React app after building it:
1. **Build** your app using `npm run build`.
2. **Serve** it locally using `serve` or deploy it using **Netlify**, **Vercel**, **Firebase Hosting**, or any other web server.
3. **Access** the production version via the hosting service's live URL or your own web server.

Here’s a description following the structure you provided for **Emergency Center and Natural Disaster Satellite View**:

## **Inspiration**
The inspiration for the **Emergency Center and Natural Disaster Satellite View** stemmed from the growing need for a fast, accurate, and integrated platform to manage natural disasters and emergencies. With climate change leading to more frequent and severe natural disasters, we wanted to create a system that could help emergency services and the public respond more effectively. The combination of satellite data and real-time AI analytics provided a unique opportunity to develop a solution that could make disaster management more proactive and informed.

## **What it does**
**Emergency Center and Natural Disaster Satellite View** offers a real-time satellite view of areas affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and earthquakes. The platform provides emergency services with up-to-date information on the scale of disasters, infrastructure damage, and areas most in need of assistance. It features live data feeds from satellite images, drones, and ground sensors, overlaid with key metrics like population density, risk levels, and evacuation routes. This allows for optimized disaster response strategies, improved resource allocation, and real-time communication with emergency responders. Additionally, AI-driven predictive models help forecast the impact of ongoing disasters, offering early warnings for communities at risk.

## **How we built it**
We built this platform using **React** for the frontend, combined with **TypeScript** for strong typing and easier maintenance. Satellite images and geospatial data were integrated using **Google Earth Engine** and **NASA's Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC)**. To provide real-time tracking and updates, we used **WebGL** for rendering interactive maps and satellite views, while **TensorFlow.js** powered the AI-driven predictive analytics for disaster forecasting. The integration of real-time sensor data, like traffic, population density, and weather patterns, was managed through APIs from government agencies and IoT networks. **AR.js** was used to provide augmented reality overlays in the emergency center, enabling first responders to visualize critical infrastructure and access routes on-site.

## **Challenges we ran into**
One of the biggest challenges was processing the massive amount of satellite data in real-time without compromising performance. Balancing high-resolution satellite imagery with fast rendering for seamless navigation required a combination of advanced caching mechanisms and optimized WebGL shaders. Another challenge was ensuring the accuracy of the AI-driven predictions, as the models had to be trained on a wide variety of historical data sets to account for different disaster scenarios. Lastly, integrating various real-time data sources—satellites, drones, ground sensors—into one cohesive system, while ensuring the data synchronization remained reliable and precise, was particularly difficult.

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**
We’re proud to have created a platform that can visualize satellite imagery in real time, offering emergency responders a powerful tool for quick decision-making during natural disasters. The successful integration of predictive AI models for disaster impact forecasting is a major achievement, helping authorities anticipate disaster outcomes and plan accordingly. We also implemented seamless real-time communication between different data sources, allowing the platform to update critical information like road closures and rescue efforts dynamically.

## **What we learned**
This project significantly expanded our understanding of geospatial data processing and real-time AI analytics. We learned to optimize large-scale satellite imagery for performance without losing critical detail, as well as the importance of accurate AI modeling in disaster scenarios. Additionally, we gained experience working with a range of APIs for live data feeds, particularly in ensuring that data from different sources remained synchronized and accurate in high-stakes situations. Our knowledge of disaster response protocols and their technological needs also grew significantly.

## **What's next for Emergency Center**
Our next steps for the platform include expanding its predictive capabilities by incorporating more complex AI models for a wider range of natural disasters. We also plan to integrate drone technology for localized, real-time imaging of disaster zones to complement satellite views, providing more granular data to first responders. Additionally, we aim to improve the AR features by adding overlays of real-time infrastructure conditions, like damaged buildings or blocked roads, to enhance decision-making on the ground. We’re also looking into creating a mobile version of the platform for use by local authorities and on-the-ground rescue teams, with offline capabilities in low-connectivity areas.
